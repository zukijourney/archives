# g4f-archives

Welcome to the g4f-archives repository! This project hosts an archive of 'resources' related to the GPT4Free community. The archive is accessible at [https://archives.zukijourney.com](https://archives.zukijourney.com).

## About the Archive

The g4f-archives is a community-driven repository that collects and preserves historical evidence of the GPT4Free community's shenanigans and incidents. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and easily navigable archive that serves as a valuable resource for anyone in the community, and to commemorate some of the wildest incidents of this space.
